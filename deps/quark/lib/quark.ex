defmodule Quark do
  @moduledoc ~S"""
  Top-level module. Provides a convenient `use` macro for importing the most
  commonly used functions and macros.

  Due to performance reasons, many of the combinators are given non-combinatory
  implementations (ie: not everything is expressed in terms `s` and `k`)
